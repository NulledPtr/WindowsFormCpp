<h1>Making a C++/CLR Windows Form Application in Visual Studio</h1>

CLR can be found by configuring the Visual Studio Installer.

C++ Windows forms. It focuses standard C++, not C++/CLI. The main difference between the examples from this book and a traditional C++ textbook is, that instead of using the console for user interaction

cout << "Hello world" << endl;

you can use a Windows control, e.g. a TextBox

textBox1->AppendText("Hello World");
